This story has potential, but it's drowning in exposition and lacks the visceral impact it could have. Here's a brutal, but hopefully constructive, critique:

**1. "Show, Don't Tell": The Curse of Exposition**

* **Over-reliance on Description:** The opening paragraphs are a deluge of telling, not showing. We're told the Leviathan is "colossal," the Citadel is "rusted," and the ship is a "graveyard of forgotten dreams."  Instead of simply stating these things, immerse us in the atmosphere. Let us see the rust flake off the Citadel, feel the chill of the recycled air, hear the groaning of the ship's metal.
* **Character Description:** Kai is introduced through a laundry list of traits - unruly hair, distant gaze, etc. This feels like a character sheet, not a living person. Reveal his personality through action, dialogue, and internal thoughts. Show us his fascination with salvaged tech by showing him meticulously taking apart a device, not just telling us about it.
* **The Problem with "Whispers":** Phrases like "whispers of forgotten dreams" and "silent warnings of a past that refused to be forgotten" are vague and clich√©d.  Show us the whispers through specific details: a flickering light, a strange sound, a half-forgotten inscription.  

**2. Dialogue: Where are the Characters?**

* **Lack of Conversation:**  The dialogue is flat and functional.  "Scrapheap salvage," he muttered, "another day in paradise."  This doesn't reveal anything about Kai's character or emotions. 
* **Missed Opportunities:** The scene with Anya and Kai in the Graveyard offers a perfect opportunity for dialogue. Instead of just stating their situation, let them argue, banter, or reveal their anxieties through conversation. 

**3. Narrative: A Sense of Urgency**

* **Plot Feels Stale:** The plot follows a predictable formula:  discovery of powerful artifact, escape from authorities, journey to sanctuary, conflict with opposing forces.  This needs to be shaken up.
* **Lack of Tension:** The story is more like a series of events than a gripping narrative. We're told about the Consortium's pursuit, but we don't feel the urgency of their chase. Show the Consortium's agents closing in, their ships swarming, the air crackling with danger.

**4. The World Needs Depth**

* **Vagueness:**  Terms like "Consortium" and "Breakers" lack context. Who are these organizations? What are their motivations? Why do they fight? Give us a glimpse into their history, their power struggles, their ideals.
* **The Leviathan as a Setting:** The Leviathan is described, but it doesn't feel like a living, breathing world.  Exploit its unique features.  How does its gravity affect movement?  What strange creatures inhabit its atmosphere?  How does it influence the characters?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Focus on Action and Emotion:**  Show Kai wrestling with the weight of the blueprints, Anya struggling with the ethical implications of the amplifier.  
* **Use Dialogue to Reveal Character:**  Let Kai and Anya argue about their past, their motivations, and their fears.  
* **Create a Sense of Immediacy:**  Make the Consortium's pursuit feel real and dangerous. Show us their tactics, their ships, their relentless pursuit.
* **Develop the World:**  Flesh out the Consortium, the Breakers, and the Leviathan's environment. 

**Overall:** The concept of "Space Engineers" has potential, but it needs to be more immersive, emotionally engaging, and  grounded in a richer world. Remember, the goal is to make the reader forget they're reading and instead feel like they're  part of the story, witnessing the events unfold around them.
